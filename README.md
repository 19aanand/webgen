# [Web Genomics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/vertically-integrated-projects/teams/webgen_~_web_genomics/)
Precision Medicine requires an ever growing Biomedical BigData reference. This growth is particularly striking for pathologies with a genomic basis, like Cancer. Accordingly, NIH/NCI has spearheaded the establishment of interoperable multi-petabyte sized Genomic Data Commons (gdc.cancer.gov) as a data ecosystem that the scientific community, including the citizen scientist, can populate with analytical applications. The goal of this project is to explore this new data-rich landscape by developing nimble Web Applications (Apps) that help find novel associations between genomic features and cancer phenotypes.

Issues: Cancer Genomics, Web Technologies, JavaScript, Artificial Intelligence, scalable distributed computing, social coding, patient-centered cancer prevention and treatment.

Methods & Technologies: Web Technologies (JavaScript, Apps), Cancer Genomics, Computational Statistics, Artificial Intelligence, Precision Medicine

Disciplines: Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Biomedical Engineering, Biomedical Informatics, Computer Engineering, Computer Science

Interests / Preparation by Major: Pre-existing knowledge of programming, particularly JavaScript, will be favored as it indicates an innate interest in social coding (user-facing application development). This is applicable to all students, regardless of focus being on Mathematics or Molecular Biology.
