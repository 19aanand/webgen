        Precision medicine requires an ever growing biomedical "big data" reference.
        This growth is particularly striking for pathologies with a genomic basis, like cancer.
        Accordingly, NIH/NCI has spearheaded the establishment of an interoperable, multi-petabyte sized
        <a href="https://gdc.cancer.gov/" target=_blank>Genomic Data Commons (GDC) </a> as a data ecosystem that the scientific community, including the citizen-scientist,
        can populate with analytical applications. The goal of this project is to explore this new data-rich landscape
        by developing a nimble Web Application (App) that will help find novel associations between genomic features
        and cancer phenotypes.
